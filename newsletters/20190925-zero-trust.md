Hey there!

> TL;DR: Learnk8s Academy discount ends today, and we published an article on securing Secrets in Kubernetes

## Last call

The Learnk8s Academy is live and to celebrate the release we discounted the most popular bundle for a week!

Today is the last day.

There are still a handful of hours before we close the promotion.

_"Hey, I know the deadline passed, but is there some way..."_

We get emails like this one every time we set a deadline.

But we don't make deadline exceptions because it's not fair to the people who DO decide before the opportunity expires.

If a hacker can retrieve one of these secrets, they could connect to your database without you even noticing it.

❓How do you secure your secrets?
❓Do you keep a copy or rely on Kubernetes to be the only source of truth?
❓How do you back them up?
❓What if you keep a copy and they go out of sync?

Omer wrote an excellent article presenting three options for managing secrets in Kubernetes securely:

- Sealed Secretes
- Helm Secrets
- Kamus
