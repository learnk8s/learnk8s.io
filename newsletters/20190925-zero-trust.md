Hey there!

_TL;DR: Learnk8s Academy discount ends today, and we published an article on securing Kubernetes secrets in Git._

**1. Last call**

The Learnk8s Academy is live and to celebrate the release we discounted the most popular bundle for a week!

**Today is the last day.**

There are still a handful of hours before we close the promotion.

But we don't make deadline exceptions because it's not fair to the people who DO decide before the opportunity expires.
