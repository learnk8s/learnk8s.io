Hi there!

_Have you ever created a cluster and wondered what type of worker nodes you should use?_

For example, if you're on Amazon Web Services, should you use a large number of of small and cheap `t2.micro` instances?

Or just some few large and powerful `m5.xlarge` instances?

Or, if your're on Google Cloud Platform, should you use eight `n1-standard-1` machines or two `n1-standard-4` machines?

Both options give you the same amount of CPU and memory in your cluster.

_So what's the best way?_ ðŸ¤”

In general, you can achieve a certain CPU and memory capacity across your cluster both by using a lot of small nodes and by using few large nodes.

**Both are viable approaches and have their pros and cons.**

If you're interested what these pros and cons are, then read our latest article:

[**Should you have many small nodes or few large nodes in your cluster?**](TODO)

What are your own experiences with using many small nodes vs. few larges nodes?

Which option works for you and why?

Let us know about it!
