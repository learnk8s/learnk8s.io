Hi there!

At around 2 pm today (that's London time zone, [check in your time zone](https://everytimezone.com/s/6344c718)) the Learnk8s Academy will be live!

here are the four most important details you should know before joining:

**1️⃣ The Learnk8s Academy is a hands-on, online course**

You become a Kubernetes expert practising your skills writing real code (_cough_ and not watching videos _cough_).

**2️⃣ You learn how to use (and break) Kubernetes**

That's a must-have if you want to build your cluster later.

**3️⃣ You can study offline too**

The content is nicely formatted as an ebook too.

**4️⃣ One time fee, lifetime updates — even if Kubernetes ever goes 2.0**

Kubernetes changes at a fast pace, but you can rely on the Academy to be always up to date.

_Still not convinced?_

**🚀 Software engineers and DevOps that master Kubernetes have 10 to 20% higher wages than the who don't.**

As if that weren't enough, [the demand for Kubernetes engineers is raising sharply](https://www.hntrends.com/2019/sep-react-reaches-thirty-percent-posts.html?compare=Kubernetes&compare=&compare=&compare=).

💰 To celebrate the release of the Learnk8s Academy, we have discounted 30% to all products!

The offer is available for one week only, though.

P.S.: _Kubernetes is here to stay._

Mastering Kubernetes is a skill that will be valuable for the next 5 to 10 years.
