Hi there!

You're receiving this email because you recently tried the Learnk8s Academy.

_There's some news for you._

**1️⃣ Download your certificate of completion!**

When you complete the Zero to Kubernetes course, you can also apply for a certificate of completion.

There's a catch, though._

The certificate is hidden behind a challenge, and you can reveal it only by solving it.

[Download your certificate →](https://academy.learnk8s.io/dashboard "Download your certificate")

**2️⃣ More hands-on challenges**

If you like getting your hands dirty, you will love the new challenges for the Kubernetes Fundamentals course.

The challenges are designed to help you practice deployments in Kubernetes.

**3️⃣ A better learning experience**

In the past six months you asked for:

- offline access to the Academy
- tracking progress online
- no more subscription — a single, one-time fee

Your voice was heard loud and clear.

The Learnk8s Academy is **available as ebooks** so that you can download and study when you're commuting.

You can **track progress as you read** through the content.

And best of all, **no more subscriptions**.

You can buy access to the content and use it how many times you want for as long as you want.

_Interested in getting access to the rest of the material?_
