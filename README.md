## How to create a new article

hello git - test-mg branch

1. Make a copy of an existing article:
    ```bash
    cp -r src/existing-article src/new-article
    cd src/new-article
    ```

1. Clear the content file:
    ```bash
    echo "Hello world" >content.md
    ```

1. Clear the assets directory:
    ```bash
    rm assets/*
    ```

1. Rename the title images:
    ```bash
    mv existing-article.png new-article.png
    mv existing-article.svg new-article.svg
    ```

1. Adapt the footer content file with the related articles:
    ```bash
    vim content-related.md
    ```

1. Adapt the index file of the article (use lots of search/replace):
    ```bash
    vim index.tsx
    ```

1. Add the article to `src/register.ts`:
    ```bash
    vim ../register.ts
    ```

1. Verify source code edits by running tests:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

1. Build and run the website:
    ```bash
    ENVENTBRITE_TOKEN=1 ENVENTBRITE_ORG=1 npm run build && npm start
    ```

## How to run the website locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Build:

```bash
ENVENTBRITE_TOKEN=1 ENVENTBRITE_ORG=1 npm run build
```

or, if you're on Windows:

```powershell
$Env:ENVENTBRITE_TOKEN=1
$Env:ENVENTBRITE_ORG=1
npm run build
```

Run:

```bash
npm start
```

The command starts a REPL session.

## Checking your writing

[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is an app that assesses a piece of writing for common grammar mistakes and offers suggestions for correcting them.

### Check Posts with Grammarly

Prior to submitting a new blog post for review via Pull Request, please make sure that you check the content with Grammarly.

Grammarly currently does not support Markdown file import, so you will need to copy and paste your post content into a new file.

In the [My Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/), click the **New** icon to create a file. Then paste the contents of your post into the editor. Fortunately, Grammarly is good at ignoring things like code blocks so you shouldn't need to worry about being repeatedly told that `someFunction() {` is improper grammar.

When you paste your text, Grammarly sends the content to its servers and runs a grammar check. The number of issues is shown in the bottom right of the app. **Critical Issues** should be addressed. **Advanced Issues** are only available to paid users.
