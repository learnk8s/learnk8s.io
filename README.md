## How to create a blog post

You should store posts in the `_blog` folder. Usually, Jekyll stores blog posts in the `_posts` folder. However, that prevents posts from having locally scoped assets such as images or code. In fact, you're only allowed to have flat files and not folders under `_posts`.

> While [there's a plugin to work around the challenge of having locally scoped assets](https://github.com/nhoizey/jekyll-postfiles), it's not ideal. It breaks compatibility with other plugins, and it is difficult to reason about tags such as the include_relative. It's also not actively maintained.

The name of the folder in `_blog` is also the slug of the post. The article should be named `index` â€” if you're using markdown, that's `index.md`.

You can include resources with [the include_relative tag](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/#including-files-relative-to-another-file).

Using a non-standard approach to store blog posts has some pros and cons. Here's a list of cons:

- The URL of the post is "<folder name>/index". The _link_ tag and generating permalink had to patched to play nicely.
- All resources within the post folder are copied across.
- You should iterate through the collection with `for item in site.<collection name>`
- Drafts are not possibile with collections

### Post Author

You can specify the author's name for every blog post by setting the front-matter property like so:

`author: "Author Name and Surname"`

You can also set the author's avatar for every blog post by setting the front-matter property like so:

`author_avatar: "author_name_and_surname.extension"`

Jekyll will find the avatar image file in `/assets`

Please note that if no `author` is specified, Jekyll will default to "Daniele Polencic".

On the other hand, if an `author` is specified but `author_avatar` is not, then Jekyll will try to find the images in `/assets` by using the author's name in lowercase and replaces "spaces" with an underscore. It will also assume that the image the extension is ".jpg".

If the above fails, then no image will be shown on top of the Author's name.

### Post Excerpt

You can specify the article's excerpt to be displayed in the article list
page by adding and setting the front-matter property:

`excerpt: "Your brief description"`

Please check how it looks and fits on the page once set.

### Links

If you need to include an external link, you can use an available `include
directive` as opposed to standard HTML. To do so, simply add the following to
 your article:

```
{% include link.external.html href="http://example.com" text="Text you want
to show" %}
```

___Optional arguments:___

As you might of assumed the `href` ad the `text` arguments are required in
order for link to be shown and to be directed appropriately. You can pass
additional arguments for the `title` and the `rel` options as follows:

1) Rel

The default setting if not stated is `rel=nofollow`. Setting this attribute
will override the default setting. For example, this setting:

```
{% include link.external.html href="http://example.com" text="Text you want
to show" rel="noopener" %}
```

will result as:

```html
<a href="http://example.com" rel="noopener">Text you want to show</a>
```

2) Title

If you do not specify a title, the text will be used by default. You can
override the default title by setting it, Like so:

```html
<a href="http://example.com" title="Your desired title">Text you want to
show</a>
```

## Redirecting old URLs

If you want to change the URL of an existing blog post and redirect the old URL to the new URL, you will need to follow some easy steps.

For example, you have a published post at this URL: `https://learnk8s.io/blog/my-post` and thus the content is located in `_blog/my-post/index.md`. Now you want to change the post's URL to `/blog/my-new-post` and you also want to redirect all hits from `/blog/my-post` to `/blog/my-new-post`.

1) Create a new directory `_blog/my-new-post`

2) Copy the content from `_blog/my-post` to the new directory

3) Update the front-matter of `_blog/my-new-post-index.md` so that it uses the resources from the new directory.

4) Delete all the contents of the `_blog/my-post` excluding the `index.md` file.

5) Update the front-matter of `_blog/my-post-index.md` so that it only includes the following:

```yaml
layout: redirect
redirect: "/blog/my-new-post"
```

In some cases you may need to make changes to the include statements in `styles.scss`.

You may also wish to keep all the resources in their original post directory and only copy the `index.md` file. On this case, you will not need to make any changes to the new post's front-matter links.
